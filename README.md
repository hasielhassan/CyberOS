# CyberOS 🌐

> **"The Ultimate Aspirational Spy Hacker Console"**

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
**CyberOS is currently a "Mock Hacker Console".** 
Nothing you see is real data. No satellites are actually being tracked, no DNA is being sequenced, and no nuclear codes are being generated. It is a visual simulation designed for fun and immersion. (Just in case 🙃)

## 🚀 Vision

**CyberOS** is a playful, immersive "hacker operating system" designed to be a digital playground for tech enthusiasts, kids, and anyone who loves the cyberpunk aesthetic. 

Think of it as a blend between **"Carmen San Diego"** and **"Mr. Robot"**.

It starts as a satisfying, interactive dashboard full of graphs, maps, and data streams that look cool but are just for fun. 

I built this to play with my kids, but I think it might also be fun for others who just want to feel like a hacker for a bit.

As it evolves, it will become a gamified platform for learning geography, cryptography, and logic through puzzles and missions.
