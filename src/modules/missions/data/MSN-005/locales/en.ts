    briefing: "Infiltrate a remote server farm and deploy the Blackout virus.",
    fullDescription: "A rogue server farm in Siberia is hosting illegal AI training operations. Your mission is to use the Satellite view to locate the exact coordinates, decrypt their firewall using the Decryptor module, and deploy the Blackout virus via Terminal commands. You have a 15-minute window before backup systems engage.",
